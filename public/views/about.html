                On Thursday 10th March 2015 hundreds of people from Logan City came together at Woodridge State High School to witness something remarkable: <span class="highlight">All four Mayoral candidates promising to spend at least $1 million per year in Council funds to improve Logan City's public transport system</span>.
            </p>
            <p>
                That night we demanded that Logan City Council put money into public transport services and our representatives listened, which means our new Mayor <span class="highlight">Luke Smith is committed to fixing public transport and will be putting money on the table!</span>
            </p>
            <p>
                On Monday the 27th June 2016, the newly elected Council will be meeting to fix budget priorities and <span class="highlight">it's up to us to make sure they remember why we gathered at the school that night</span>. We built this website to help you spread the word.
